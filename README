Contact Engine

It's a RESTful application based on RestIgniter meant to handle info about People, Organizations, Locations and the relationships between the three objects.

The backend is LDAP and natively supports master-slave infrastructure.

The properties of the 3 objects are automatically set by parsing the ldap schema, so adding a new attribute to the schema gives a new attribute to the object.
