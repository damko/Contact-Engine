##What is Contact Engine
It's a middleware service meant to handle via API-REST information about People, Organizations, Locations and the relationships between the three objects.

Project mantra: One contact, one record.
Project mission: To make contacts data accessible from any application.

##Technical details
Contact Engine is a Code Igniter application (with Spark) loaded into RestIgniter.

The programming language is PHP and the backend is LDAP and natively supports master-slave LDAP infrastructures.

##How it works
Contact Engine acts like the opposite of a common ORM: the properties (attributes) of the 3 objects are automatically set by parsing the ldap schema. For this reason, adding a new attribute to the schema for one o more objects is enough to add a new attribute to the object.
You can refine the attributes of the 3 objects as you like without rewriting a single line of code.

##Architecture
The architecture of CE allows data access through 2 possible path: via LDAP and via REST
